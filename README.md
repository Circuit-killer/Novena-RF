# Myriad-RF Module for the Novena Open Hardware Computing Plaform

This repository contains the design and manufacturing files for an RF module that adds 300MHz-3.8GHz broadband SDR transmit/receive capability to the [Novena Open Hardware Computing Platform](http://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page).

Please note that the design has not been manufactured and fully tested as yet. However, it is derived from the tried-and-tested Myriad-RF 1 module and only relatively minor changes to this design were required.

Interest in a manufacturing run of the module is being gauged via an [online poll](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/P3C23X6).
